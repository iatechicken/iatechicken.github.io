                        <li>Weather data was frequently used at DeepLabs but was not properly managed</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Providing standardized weather data was expensive and challenging</li>
                        <li>We saved $</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h2 class="section-heading">Body</h2>
                        <p>At DeepLabs, weather data was essential since it provided strong signals for majority of our fraud detection & behavior models. Despite its importance, weather data was not managed properly and Data Scientists were collecting weather data from various sources that often overlapped in range and measurements (For example, certain weather dataset would be collected in hourly intervals while other weather dataset were collected on daily interval, another weather dataset was collected in Celsius while other weather dataset was collected in Fahrenheit). Although it wasn’t ideal, our internal users coped with this process until the team started to grow and many data scientists spent more time asking each other for the location of ad-hoc weather datasets that were either stored in local machines or temporary google cloud storage.</p>
                        <p>This was problematic and we wanted to provide efficiency for the data scientists by setting up data pipelines to regularly provide quality weather data in an easily accessible location so that data scientists can better focus on solving business problems.</p>
                        <p>Sounds simple right? However, obtaining weather data was not as easy as we thought. First, the scope of collecting weather data was not defined. We wanted US weather data, but at which granularity? At the city level? State level? County level? Zip code level? Second, what type of measurements do we want? There are hundreds of weather metrics available like windspeed, visibility, uv index, humidity, temp, etc. Last, what about the frequency? Do we need it at the hourly level or daily level? If hourly, do we need ingest the weather data every hour or can we ingest it on a daily basis? What about weekly? From the user perspective, it is natural to say “I want everything available for me right here right now!” But the reality is that we have a business to run and don’t want to break the bank. Unlike airlines or logistics business that might actually need the latest weather data on a minute basis, we were in the fraud detection space where daily or weekly ingestion of data might suffice. The key here is finding the right balance and achieving efficiency.
