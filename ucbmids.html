                        <p>This was my first “coding” class in an academic setting. Coming in with only 2+ years of SQL and some decent excel skills, there were parts that were easy to understand like If conditions, and different data structures like float vs int. However, what I remember most from this class were two things:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Great community. Our class was comprised of students with no python background from all ages and all genders. With a common goal of learning, everybody (including the TAs and the instructors) helped each other out and was readily available!</li>
                          <li>Like any languages, English, French, Spanish, or Chinese, there’s unbelievable depths and nuisance in Python. To name a quick example, a simple list comprehension can replace a for loop that’s 10+ lines long. Productivity can’t be measured by the volume of code, yet we should try to evaluate the quality of the code that’s being produced.</li>

                        <p>I was a bit hesitant to take this class since I already had decent business intelligence/data visualization background. I'm proficient with Tableau and have delivered data visualizations to managers of global pharmaceutical companies through SiSense and Microsoft PowerBI. However, this class made me realize that we're all actually spoiled by the data visualization tools out there. A lot of the fundamental concepts/theory behind designing a good data visualization that we learned in this class, is already selected/guided by tools such as Tableau or SiSense. We not only learned the fundamentals of good data visualization, but also learned how to code our own data visualization through D3.js. After all, a picture is worth more than thousand words.</p>

                        <p>This was my official introduction to Machine Learning. Yes, it took only about a year before I actually got the chance to do Machine Learning. I got a chance to learn from Yacov Salomon and one thing I will remember the most is his whiteboard and always dry markers… and how he always emphasized the importance of understanding the intuition behind any algorithms. To get a better understanding of what I mean, take a look at the Q&A below from one of the assignments:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Q: Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?</blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">A: The difference between Naive Bayes and logistic regression is that Naive Bayes assumes independence amongst features while logistic regression looks for relationships between features. Since we're dealing with more than 2,000 features, the logistic regression will perform badly due to complexity. If we want to improve the performance of our logistic regression model, we must reduce the number of features</blockquote>

                        <p>Despite the fact that data is growing at an exponential rate, there are so many un-captured data in the wild. This is where edge computing comes in and what this class is all about. Our first task was to setup a NVIDIA Jetson TX-2 with ubuntu. With the Jetson and IBM Cloud, we got to experiment with various algorithms of Deep Learning and truly appreciate the possibilities of big data.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: If you're not sure what Jetson TX-2 is, Bin Wang provided a nice video below that basically describes the first week of class for us</p>

                          </h3>
                        <p>Can weather data and basic airline metadata be used to predict whether or not a given flight will be delayed at a level of accuracy that will be practically useful? We used 'PySpark.ml.feature VectorAssembler' to prepare feature engineered data for Linear Regression and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models. Although the results were not promising (RMSE ~42.15 and ~78.2% accuracy) for our final model, it was a good data science experience with my teammates Andrew Webb, Suzy Choi, and Pierce Coggins. To be specific, we got to experience the process of preparing our own data from scratch for the analysis and the invaluable experience of explaining why it wasn't effective. (This is the hard part!)</p>
